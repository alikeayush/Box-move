# Moving Object Project

This project is a simple demonstration of how to create a webpage where an object (in this case, a box) moves across the screen using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`), a CSS file (`style.css`), and a JavaScript file (`script.js`). The HTML file contains the structure of the webpage, the CSS file contains the styling, and the JavaScript file contains the logic for moving the object.

## Features

- **Moving Object:** The main feature of the project is the ability to move an object horizontally across the screen.
- **Animation:** The object moves smoothly using CSS animations.
- **Responsive Design:** The webpage is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. You should see a box moving horizontally across the screen.
